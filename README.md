This repo shows 3 main projects in the healthcare domain that I worked on. 

1. Chronic Kidney Disease Survival Analysis
      To identify factors causing chronic kidney disease
      Build a predictive model to identify subjects, who could potentially be affected by CKD.
      Interpret the statistical model to estimate the impact of each factor leading to CKD
     
2. Parkinsons Prediction using Random Forest
      Random Forest Classifiers to predict patients exhibiting Parkinson's disease.
      Uni-variate & Multivariate analysis, Principal Component Analysis for the identification of key features
      Achieved 92% accuracy and 86% Recall with Logistic Regression on the test dataset.
      
3. Mission Hospital Package pricing strategy analysis
      Predictive Model to estimate the price of treatment given the clinical factors at the time of admission.
      Data Preparation
        Removed columns with missing observations as "1"(Target)
        Numerical values were grouped and One hot encoded. 
        Performed T-test and Anova to check significance. 
      Logistic Regression Model to understand the relation between target variable and feature engineered variables.
        Accuracy- 91.5%
